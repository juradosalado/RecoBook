            <h2 class="question">How does Recobook work?</h2>
            <p>Recobook is a Dialogflow agent that use Natural Language Processing to understand what user says and process it to data.
                 Recobook catchs your reading preferences and throw that information to a Recommendation System with
                  constraint-based recommendation, which calculates a score for every single book in Data Base based in your preferences.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="question">How is Recobook different from the Recommendation Systems from webs like Amazon or GoodReads?</h2>
            <p>Most Recommendation Systems try to find similarity betweeen books you liked and other books. They can also find similarity
                between you and other profiles, and then recommend you books that people like you enjoyed. However, you can not "tell" those
                systems what you want to read. With Recobook, you can just tell him to find you a mystery book, with no more than 200 pages,
                similar to that book you read from that author and with your favorite city as the setting of the plot. And just by talking to Recobook!
                It is really that easy.

            <h2 class="question">How can I use Recobook?</h2>
            <p>Reobook is a totally free chatbot. To use Recobook, you just have to respond our chatbot questions as he suggest you to do. For every parameter that
                Recobook can scrore for you (genres, number of pages...), it will first ask you for a particular value for that parameter. For example, for genres it
                will ask you what genres would you want your next read to have. In this type of questions, you can always skip those questions
                if you don't care about a question's parameter just typing "skip". For example, if you are not looking for a particular
                genre, when the chatbot asks you about genres, just type "skip" and it will ask you about something else! Then, whenever you are actually
                interested and answer a question, the chatbot will ask you a relevance number for that parameter, which must be an integer from 1 to 10. That
                relevance will be important to add more or less scrore to books that accomplish your parameter preference. For example, if you want
                for sure a mystery book, give a 10 to genres relevance. And if you want a book with less than 400 pages but that's not a must have, give pages relevance a 3.
                At the end of the conversation, Recobook will provide you your recommendation results. I hope you enjoy it!
